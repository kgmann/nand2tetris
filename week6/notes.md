## Summary
This week has mainly been about software. We wrote an assembler in a high level programming language of our choice (I did it in Python) for the Hack symbolic machine language. It basically converts hack assembly code to binary code that can be loaded in the ROM and run on a Hack Computer.

# Terminologies
cross-compiler, symbol table, macro assembler, macro-commands, 


## Other Notes
- It was a fun exercise to write the assembler
- I didn't know that C compilers allow embedding assembly code in programs.
